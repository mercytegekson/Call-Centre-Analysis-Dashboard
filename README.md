This Power BI dashboard provides insights into call center operations, including answered calls, unresolved calls, and weekly trends.

## Key Perfomance Metrics
- Total Answered & Unanswered Calls
- Weekly Call Trends
- Agent Performance Analysis
- Interactive Visuals

## Visualizations
Here are some visualizations and insights of the dashboard:

The trend shows fluctuations in answered calls over the weeks. Week 1 had the highest number, followed by a sharp decline in Week 2. Thereafter, the call volume fluctuates, peaking again in Week 6 before slightly dropping in Week 7. The dip in Week 2 could indicate operational issues, while the peaks may be linked to increased demand or improved efficiency. Further analysis is needed to understand the reasons behind these variations.

### Agent's Perfomance

The performance summary shows that Jim handled the highest number of answered calls (536), while Stewart had the lowest (477). Dan had the highest average satisfaction score (3.45), indicating better customer experience, while Joe had the lowest (3.33). The total answered calls across all agents are 4,054, with 3,646 resolved calls, suggesting a high resolution rate. Further analysis can help identify factors influencing satisfaction scores and call resolution efficiency.
